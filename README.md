# Lyrical-cover-of-Tum-hi-ho-
This is the cover song of the original song "Tum hi ho" by Arijit Singh

You're the light that guides my way,
In your love, I'll always stay.
Every moment, night and day,
With you, my heart will never sway.

In your eyes, I find my home,
Wherever we go, we'll never be alone.

Tum hi ho, tum hi ho,
My love for you will always grow.
Tere liye, har pal, har roz,
With you, my love, forever close.

Through the storms and darkest night,
With you, everything feels right.
In your arms, I find my strength,
Our love, unbreakable at any length.

Tum hi ho, tum hi ho,
Our love's a fire that'll never go low.
Tere liye, har pal, har roz,
With you, my love, forever close.

Tum hi ho, tum hi ho,
In your love, my emotions overflow.
Tere liye, har pal, har roz,
With you, my love, forever close.
